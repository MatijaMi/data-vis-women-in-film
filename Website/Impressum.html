      <h1>Data Protection and Privacy Statement</h1>

      <h3>Validity</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        The Data Protection and Privacy Statement is currently valid and was
        last amended on March 26th, 2021.
      </div>

      <h3>General Information on the Processing of your Data</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        Data processing by the Philipps-Universität Marburg, hereinafter
        referred to as the University, is carried out according to legal data
        protection regulations, in particular according to the provisions of
        Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council dated 27
        April 2016. This concerns the protection of natural persons with regard
        to the processing of their personal data, the free movement of such
        data, and the termination of the Directive 95/46/EG Data Protection
        Basic Regulation (DSGVO), and the Hessian Data Protection and Freedom of
        Information Act (HDSIG) in the version effective from 25 May, 2018.<br /><br />
        According to Article 13 DSGVO, the University has an obligation to
        inform when collecting personal data. The service provider [...] “ makes
        available to the person concerned at the point in time when the data is
        being collected [...] information which is necessary in order to
        guarantee fair and transparent data processing.”<br /><br />
        The University takes the protection of your personal data seriously. It
        would like to inform you in a precise, transparent, understandable and
        easily accessible form about what data is collected when accessing this
        project website and how it is used.<br /><br />
        Due to future technological developments, changes to the content of this
        data protection and privacy statement may become necessary. The
        University expects you to check regularly whether an updated statement
        is available and to review it.
      </div>

      <h3>Processing of your Personal Data</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        This data protection and privacy statement applies to the web pages
        offered on the web server of the University and to the personal and
        non-personal data collected during access to these web pages.<br />
        Your data is stored or processed only in the State of Hessen, Federal
        Republic of Germany, and not in countries that are outside the scope of
        the DSGVO.
      </div>

      <h3>Personal Data</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        According to Article 4 DSGVO, personal data is “all information which
        relates to an identified or identifiable natural person [...]. An
        identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
        indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
        identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or
        more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
        economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.”
      </div>

      <h3>Data for Delivery of the Website</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        In order to deliver the website to your computer or web browser, a
        temporary storage of the IP address by the web server is necessary.
      </div>

      <h3>Logged Data and Storage Period</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        When accessing the web pages offered by the University, the following
        data is stored in the form of access logs: <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
        the client's IP address<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
        the (server) time of access<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
        the HTTP method and the URL of the request<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
        the HTTP status code of the server response<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
        the byte size of the server response<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
        the page of origin (the “referrer”) submitted by the browser<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
        the user agent (the browser's software name)<br /><br />
        Accesses to our web pages are stored in log files for seven full days
        and then deleted by rotation. The IP addresses stored in the log files
        are truncated by the last byte and thus made anonymous. The assignment
        of an IP address to a natural person is thus not possible or only
        possible with a disproportionately large effort.<br />
        In order to defend against an ongoing or imminent deliberate attack on
        the web server and to preserve evidence, the University reserves the
        right to temporarily disable the anonymization of the IP address in the
        log files.
      </div>

      <h3>Links to other Websites</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        The web pages offered by the University may contain references (“links”)
        to websites of other providers, for example via social media icons to
        Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or YouTube. The University has no
        influence on whether these providers also comply with the legal data
        privacy and security regulations. Please always check the privacy
        statements of the providers.
      </div>

      <h3>
        Recipients of your Data in Compliance with Legal or Judicial Obligations
      </h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        The data recorded during your access of web pages offered by the
        University will only be forwarded to third parties if the University is
        legally obliged to do so, or in the case of a court ruling, or if it is
        necessary for legal or criminal prosecution in the event of an attack on
        the web server.
      </div>

      <h3>Your Rights</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        As a user of our website you have specific rights according to Articles
        15 to 18, 21 DSGVO and HDSIG: right to information, right to correction
        and data deletion, right to limit the data processed, right to object,
        and right of complaint.
      </div>

      <h3>Right to Information</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        According to Article 17 DSGVO, you can request information on your
        personal data processed by the University. In your request for
        information disclosure you should specify precisely your key concerns in
        order to facilitate the compilation of the necessary data. Please note
        that your right to information is limited by the rules of HDSIG.
      </div>

      <h3>Right to Data Deletion</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        In accordance with Article 17 DSGVO and § 34 HDSIG you have the right to
        request the deletion of your personal data. Your right to deletion is
        dependent on certain conditions, for example whether the University
        requires your data in order to comply with our legal obligations.
      </div>

      <h3>Right to object</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        According to Article 21 DSGVO, you have the right to object to the
        processing of data concerning you at any time on reasons relating to
        your particular situation. However, the University may not always be
        able to comply your objection, for example if according to § 35 HDSIG
        the University is legally obliged to process your personal data. Please
        note that if you wish to access web pages offered by the University it
        is necessary to process the IP address of your client.
      </div>

      <h3>Right to lodge a Complaint</h3>

      <div class="introduction-text">
        If in your opinion the University has not complied with the legal
        regulations on data protection, you may lodge a complaint with the
        official data protection officer at the University of Marburg or with
        the regulatory authority responsible for data processing in public
        institutions of the State of Hessen and request them to examine your
        complaint.

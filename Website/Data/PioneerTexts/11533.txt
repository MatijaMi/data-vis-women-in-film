Mary Manning was one of a handful of women active behind the camera in Ireland’s two waves of silent film production. Between 1914 and 1926, a prolific mass-market industry specialized in popular film genres like historical melodramas and romantic comedies and dramas. Ellen O’Mara Sullivan (co-founder of and producer at Film Company of Ireland, 1914-1920), Margaret T. Pender (source writer, O’Neil of the Glen, 1916), Ulster novelist Mrs. N. F. Patton (adapter, Knocknagow, 1918), and Dorothy Donn-Byrne (source writer, Land of Her Fathers, 1925) were the female pioneers in this first wave. Between 1930 and 1935, a second silent industry produced more experimental, less commercial films, extending this second silent era well beyond the 1927 advent of sound in the U.S and much of Europe. In addition to Manning, women filmmakers included Lettice Ramsey and British- born Frances Baker Farrell who designed sets (Some Say Chance, 1934) and Gate Theatre actress Maírín Hayes who edited (Guests of the Nation, 1935). Scholars offer few details on Manning’s contribution in this second wave, though she appears to have been one of the driving forces behind five of the six films produced. In her brief, but significant film career, Manning was a screenwriter, adapter, director, assistant director, and actress who also worked on props and casting. In addition, she was a film critic and a founding member of an art house film society and an amateur filmmaking club.

Manning’s film work evolved out of a broad interest in the arts. Born in Dublin in 1905, she briefly studied painting in London. Back in Dublin, she apprenticed under actress Sara Allgood at the Abbey Theatre. As Ireland’s official national theatre, the Abbey was at the center of the country’s cultural renaissance in the 1920s. According to scholars, the theatre asserted nationalist pride through its productions of Irish-themed plays by local writers avoiding traditional Irish theatre’s romanticized view of nationalist struggles and stereotypes of the Irish as deferential rogues and vulnerable maidens (Trotter 38-39). Manning contributed to this new aesthetic as a regular member of the Abbey players and later the newly-formed Gate Theatre in 1928, where she both acted and wrote plays. She saw her time at the Gate and the early 1930s as a period of “intellectual creativity which I’ve never known again” (Manning 1978, 39).

By the late 1920s and early 1930s Manning also was reshaping Ireland’s cinematic landscape, initially as a film critic and later as a filmmaker. Her interest in motion picture film was in keeping with the trend of many theatrical artists from the Abbey, the Irish Theatre Company (formerly the Abbey players), Trinity College Dramatic Society, and the Gate Theatre who recognized the potential for cinema to carry on the period’s cultural initiatives (Rockett 1988, 24; Barton 23, 27). As a film critic for the Irish Statesman from 1929 until it folded in 1930, Manning kept a watchful eye on British and American film imports. In “Dublin Cum-Elstree” and “What Is the Wild West Saying?” she was particularly disapproving of the Hollywood model of filmmaking with its unimaginative stories and its stereotypical portrayals of Ireland and the Irish (1929, 254-56; 1930, 497). In “A Silent Interlude” she also criticized Hollywood for its failure to evolve as an art form, praising continental European cinema for its growth and experimentation (1929, 72–73). Throughout the magazine, Manning was equally disparaging of the Irish government’s lack of support for the creative arts, including film.

Henderina (Rina) Victoria Scott, née Klaassen, was a botanist with a special interest in fossil botany and plant physiology. Our interest lies with her pioneering experiments with cinematography in the early 1900s when she photographed and exhibited around a dozen moving pictures featuring plant and flower movements.

Henderina Klaassen was born in 1862 in Brixton, Surrey. She studied advanced botany at the Royal College of Science in 1886, where she was lectured by the botanist Dukinfield Henry Scott. A successful personal and professional partnership ensued. They were married in 1887, and Rina Scott began to assist her husband with his work while also conducting her own research. They were both notable in the field of botany, and material relating to Rina Scott is archived under both her own name and her husband’s.

Other than a handful of obituaries in the scientific press, there is no real public record of Scott’s life or work. To date she has been little more than a footnote in motion picture history, cited only for showing time-lapse films at the Royal Horticultural Society in 1906 (Low 1949, 158).

However, her career deserves further investigation, the consequences of which should award her more recognition in light of her creative use of experimental photographic techniques and her enthusiasm for exhibiting her films for scientific purposes.

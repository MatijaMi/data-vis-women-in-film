Anne Bauchens was a St. Louis, Missouri native who, at the age of twenty, moved to New York City in the hope of becoming an actor and was hired by William de Mille as a typist and stenographer in 1912. Five years later, she traveled to Hollywood to help William’s brother, producer-director Cecil B. De Mille, edit We Can’t Have Everything (1918). DeMille is quoted in the Los Angeles Herald Examiner as saying about her that “though a gentle person, professionally she is as firm as a stone wall . . . We argue over virtually every picture” (III 3).  Nonetheless, she was the only person the director would permit to edit his films and continued working with him until his death in 1959.

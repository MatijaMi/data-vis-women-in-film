Caizhen Xie is regarded by several existing sources as the first female director of Chinese cinema who worked in China. (This is, of course, with Marion E. Wong in mind as the first Chinese woman to direct a film anywhere.) Tan Ye and Yun Zhu’s 2012 Historical Dictionary of Chinese Cinema, for instance, has the following description of her work:

While working for Li Jiran’s newly founded and short-lived Nanxing Film Company [Southern Star Film Company], Xie directed and starred in the silent feature film, Orphan’s Cries [sic] (1925). The only product released by Nanxing [Southern Star], the film tells about the tragic experiences of two orphans, whose late father was framed by his stepmother and estranged from his wealthy father (184).

They note that, as an actress, Caizhen also starred in Dan Duyu’s 1925 film Little Master. Prior to this, Caizhen had co-starred with leading actress Pearl Ing in Dan’s “philosophy film” Some Girl (1925). While Pearl played a country woman named Purity, Caizhen played one of her egos: Vanity. Her performance was praised by a critic using the pen name of Aiyun (17).

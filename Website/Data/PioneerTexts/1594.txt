There were two Mrs. Sidney Drews. Both wrote for their husband’s films. The first wife, Gladys Rankin, was a dramatist who wrote under the name of George Cameron. Her play became the scenario for Sidney Drew’s first motion picture The Still Voice (1913). After the death of the first Mrs. Sidney Drew in January 1914, Sidney Drew married Lucille McVey the following July. The second Mrs. Drew, who also used the name Jane Morrow, began her career as a stage actress and then joined Vitagraph in early 1914. That same year she was part of Sidney Drew’s company of players.

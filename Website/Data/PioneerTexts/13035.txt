Ironically, it is her life before the cinema that has been described in detail: sometimes it is possible to know the exact movements of Nina Agadzhanova-Shutko over a particular day, say, in 1914. It is her work in film that is little known by comparison—all because she was a revolutionary first, and a screenwriter second. The two lives famously intersected in 1925 when she wrote the synopsis for what was to become Battleship Potemkin (1925).

Nina Agadzhanova-Shutko c. 1920s, from the book Sviaznoi Moskvy (1975). 

An orphaned daughter of an Armenian merchant from the south of Russia, she joined the illegal Social-Democratic party, the future Bolshevik/Communist Party, in 1907, while still a schoolgirl. Having studied music, in 1908 she worked for several months as a silent film accompanist in Ekaterinodar, now Krasnodar, near the Black Sea. She managed to turn even the film theater into a secret Bolshevik meeting place (Leiberov and Peregudova 1985, 94).

Agadzhanova never graduated from college, although she studied history and literature in Moscow. Instead, she was put into prison six times and sent into exile twice over the course of the decade for political propaganda, often returning to the capital under false names. During one of her times in exile she met her future husband, Kirill Shutko, also a professional revolutionary whose favorite non-political activity was theater.

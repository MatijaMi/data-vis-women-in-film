Bianca Virginia Camagni was one of the first women directors in Italian silent cinema, as well as one of the most important if we take into consideration the few scattered reports in the film magazines of the time. The sources are unanimous in describing Camagni as a woman of uncommon talent and acuteness with a lively intelligence. She built around herself a unique culture based on her personality, films, collaborations, and network of relationships that made her a very special kind of diva, at variance with the mainstream conventions of the times.

In October 1939, her collaborator, Tito A. Spagnol, her partner at Camagni Films, thus described her:

Bianca Virginia Camagni whom many of you still remember, was a blonde woman from Lombardy. She was practical and energetic in an almost masculine way which, added to her feminine qualities, made her a charming and ever-changing creature. She was not arriving as other actresses of that time, from concierge or kitchen, but was instead educated, refined, spoke several languages and was a fine and sensitive pianist; she had traveled in Europe, loved the company of writers and artists, being an artist herself albeit occasionally. Whenever she was forced to distance herself from this art [film] it was the aversion to having to be subordinate to people whose talent and culture were unlike her own. Nothing was more natural then, with so much potential, than to aspire to do film herself, that is to create, as was said of those of a film who were not only its performers, but its writers and directors in concert (285).

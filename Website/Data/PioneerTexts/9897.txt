Described by The Cinema in December 1922 as “the Lady Director of Wardour Street” (8), Encarnacion Rosa Scott held a number of prominent positions in the British film renting business in the silent era. Scott was Spanish by birth and moved to London as a child. In 1914 she married Walter Comrie Scott, a British film agent who was a founding director of the American Company (London) Limited.

The company was formed in August 1911 as a manufacturer and dealer in cinematograph films and apparatuses. They were the sole and exclusive agent in the United Kingdom and Europe for the sale of the American Film Manufacturing Company’s films, including the brand names “the sign of the Flying A,” “American Beauty Films,” and “Beauty Films.”Research to date has concentrated on the Flying “A” Studios in Santa Barbara. The importance of the London company and the role of Encarnacion Scott have been somewhat overlooked.

Information concerning Scott and her business ventures is accessible in British trade magazines such as The Cinema and The Bioscope. The Kinematograph Year Book also frequently included Scott in their “Who’s What in the Trade” listing, which not only supplies factual business information, but also provides an insight into her character, and in 1923 noted that she enjoyed motoring and studying languages (271). The National Archives in Kew holds business papers for the London company and the British Film Institute also holds some rental information, along with at least forty Flying “A” prints. Despite the American Company (London) Limited being a British company, further research in American archives could prove valuable. Sifting through American Film Manufacturing Company’s archival materials may uncover references to Scott and the London wing of the American Company that has so far been neglected.

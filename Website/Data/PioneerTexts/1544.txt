In a 1922 interview with Louella Parsons, Josephine Lovett’s husband, director John S. Robertson compared his relationship with Lovett to that of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., whose married life he considered “ideal”:

They work together, play together, and plan their pictures together. Just the way people should do. I feel strongly on that subject, because my wife has been such a help and inspiration to me (4).

Parsons adds that Lovett contributed to the “visualizing” of scenes in Robertson-Lovett projects, but the ambiguity of this term reflects the difficulties of researching the career of screenwriter Josephine Lovett (4).

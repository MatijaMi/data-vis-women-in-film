Details about the life of Rosario Rodríguez de la Serna are scarce. We know only that she played a small acting role in Juro no volver a amar/I Swear I Won’t Love Again (1925). After this experience, she founded her own film company, Rosario Film, in order to direct Malditas sean las mujeres/Damned Be the Women (1925), a loose adaptation of a novel by Ibo Alfaro. In the film, a young boy, a victim of passion, falls into despair because of unrequited love and ends up killing himself. The film had limited commercial success and was exhibited at several locations in the country.

Nothing else is known about Rodríguez de la Serna until 1929, when she completed her second film, La Envenenadora/The Poisoner, an adaptation of the novel of the same title by Paul D’Aigremont. The action of this film relies on the intrigue of a woman who poisons her husband in order to take possession of his fortune and to live with her lover. However, the victim’s sister finds out about the crime, and the criminals go to jail. This film was also screened around Chile, but the public’s welcome was quite tepid, and Rodríguez de la Serna was lost in the most complete anonymity.

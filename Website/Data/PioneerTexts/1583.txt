Between 1904 and 1915, Marion Fairfax wrote several successful Broadway plays before turning to screenwriting. Over the next eleven years, she achieved even greater success in her new field. In 1921, she formed her own production company that produced The Lying Truth (1922), which Fairfax wrote and directed. The most enduring film with which she was associated was The Lost World (1925), a science fiction picture about an isolated land of dinosaurs that featured tremendous special effects. A handwritten note attached to a First National Pictures legal department memo dated December 6, 1923, states: “Fairfax is always a winner—Don’t ever let her get away. Tom [unidentified] knows she is both restless and damn independent.” Three years later, however, Fairfax received her final credit for The Blonde Saint (1926) and then disappeared from filmmaking. She was married to actor Tully Marshall, who died in 1943, for forty-three years.

Like many women filmmakers of the silent era, Fairfax began her career as a stage actress. By 1901, she was appearing on Broadway. Shortly thereafter, her own plays began appearing. In 1915, Fairfax turned to screenwriting at the suggestion of William deMille, brother of Cecil B. DeMille. Over the next few years, she wrote several films directed by deMille. Another frequent artistic collaborator was director-producer Marshall Nielan, with whom Fairfax shared a long friendship dating back to her earliest years on Broadway. Together, they produced several films covering a large number of genres from 1920 to 1925. Perhaps their biggest hit was Dinty (1920) a comic melodrama starring Colleen Moore and child star Wesley Barry. Their other films included The River’s End (1920), a Royal Canadian Mounted Police adventure; Don’t Ever Marry (1920), a marriage comedy; Bob Hampton of Placer (1921), an epic Western; Fools First (1922), about a reformed gangster; and The Lotus Eater (1921), an island romance starring John Barrymore. They also created an unusual science fiction comedy drama, Go and Get It (1920), about a murderer’s brain getting transplanted into a chimpanzee.

Male stars for whom she created scripts included Sessue Hayakawa. These works included Hashimura Togo (1917) and The Honor of His House (1918), which considered the problems of assimilation in ways comic and tragic towards the Japanese; The Secret Game (1917), a spy film in which Hayakawa foils a German threat against US transport ships; and The White Man’s Law (1918), a drama set in Sierra Leone about a corrupt English businessman who impregnates an African woman.

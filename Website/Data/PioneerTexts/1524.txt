While Thanhouser Company may not be one of the best known of the early film companies, what is certain is that its founder and public figurehead was Edwin Thanhouser. Missing from this account, however, is the critical role played by his wife, Gertrude Homan Thanhouser. She was a major contributor to the success of the Thanhouser film enterprise, where she worked as actress, scenario writer, film editor, and studio executive.

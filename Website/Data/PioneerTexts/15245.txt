Diana Karenne was one of the most interesting personalities in the Italian and European film scenes of the early 1900s. Star, actress, intellectual, artist, director, screenwriter, and producer, she is representative of an effectual coexistence between two different ways of considering a woman’s role in both the film industry and in a society that was undergoing deep changes as to gender boundaries (Guerra 2008, 39; Pravadelli 2014, 5; Vicarelli 2007, 13). Through her artistic career, she supported demands concerning female identity, widely felt between 1800 and 1900 (Bianchi 1969, 190): in this very period, Europe was facing a process of modernization and large transformations at every social level. Karenne never took sides towards women’s emancipation movements, yet she opposed conservative morals and social conventions of that time through her personal, aesthetic, and professional choices (Gaines 2008, 20), and helped to update the idea of cinema thanks to her bold artistic proposals and acting style (Bianchi 192).

Information about Karenne’s early life is very scarce. We know her actual name, Leukadia (or Leucadia) Konstantin, and that she was born in 1888, yet the date is still unknown (maybe between April 21 and May 20), as is her birthplace. The actress maintained she was born in Danzig, now Poland, even though many sources claim she was Ukrainian (Bianchi 189), Russian, or more generically “Slavic” (“Cinema italiano del tempo che fu” 11; “Diana Karenne al Modernissimo” 50). She was likely to have received theatrical training, but this has not been confirmed. As for her marital status, she is said to have been married and then divorced before emigrating to Italy, according to an article on April 30, 1917 in Film (23).

Karenne arrived in Italy in 1914. She had her first film experiences in Turin, hired in minor roles and not always credited. She paid her dues at Roma Film, where she was employed at the end of the year as an extra. She then moved to Aquila Film, where, though not mentioned in the credits, she attracted the audience’s attention for her showy make-up in Karval lo spione (1916) (Jandelli 2006, 211).
